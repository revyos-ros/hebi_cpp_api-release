ros-humble-hebi-cpp-api (3.1.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Reduce conversion needs by adding (deprecated) overloads for:
    
      * getJ
      * getJacobians
      * getFK
      * getForwardKinematics
      * getFrameCount
    
  * Fix multiple definition error
  (from 3.0.0)
  * Robot Model:
    
      * Added "input frame" type for forward kinematics operations
      * Added end effector support (custom and parallel gripper types)
      * Added R-series support (actuator, link, bracket, and end effector)
      * Added options for link input + output type
      * Support import of HRDF format 1.2.0
    
  * Robot Model:
    
      * removed "combine" functionality for addJoint and addRigidBody
      * now only allows addition of elements which match the physical interface of the previous element
      * changed the behavior of "end effector" frames; by default, none are returned any unless an "end effector" is specifically added
      * Changed usages of HebiJointType, HebiFrameType, and HebiRobotModelElementType C-style enums to C++ scoped enums
    
  * Fixed bug when setting IO pins in commands; commands would sometimes affect other pins.
  (from 2.2.0)
  * Added ability to set and clear text in the experimental mobile IO API
  * Added ability to get raw feedback from experimental mobile IO API

ros-humble-hebi-cpp-api (2.0.2-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Make package installable
  * Moved the header files into an include directory
  * Removed the Eigen folder; use ROS package instead
  * Fixed CMake for installable package
    
      * Addressed Eigen dependency
      * Installed include files and libraries correctly
    
  * NOTE: this does not correspond with an official 2.0.2
    release of the upstream HEBI C++ API, because these
    changes were all local ROS build system changes. This
    mismatch will be resolved in v2.1.0.

ros-humble-hebi-cpp-api (2.0.1-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

    compliant.
  * Addressed i386/armhf/aarch64 ros buildfarm issues.
